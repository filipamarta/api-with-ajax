# api-with-ajax
In this project I use an API (a tomcat webapp) called javabank and manipulate that data through AJAX. It exchange data with a server (tomcat), and update parts of a responsive web page. I used HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, jQuery and Javascript. This project was made during the bootcamp at Academia de CÃ³digo.
